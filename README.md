# ca-mera algorithm
Algorithm used in the ca-mera app made available under GPL v3 - have fun experimenting with it!

The goal of this repository is to make the algorithm used in MNSP's ca-mera app available to the wider Glitch Art community (and really anyone interested in processing images with cellular automata).

To start out, a simple Processing.org implementation is provided. Further implementations may follow.

The original ca-mera app can be found here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ca-mera/id1271078637
